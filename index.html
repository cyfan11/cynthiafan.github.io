Hi! I'm a senior undergraduate student at Davidson College, majoring in Mathematics (honors) and Computer Science. I'm currently working with <a href="https://www.davidson.edu/people/tim-chartier">Dr. Tim Chartier</a> on my honor thesis in applied math track about dominance graph and ranking. I'm also continuing to work with my summer research group at MIT led by Paul Zhang on hex mesh decomposition.

I'm broadly interested in geometry processing, computer graphics, graph theory, machine learning as well as data analytics.
