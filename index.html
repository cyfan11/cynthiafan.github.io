Hi! I'm a senior undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.davidson.edu">Davidson College</a>, majoring in Mathematics (honors) and Computer Science. I'm currently working with <a href="https://www.davidson.edu/people/tim-chartier">Dr. Tim Chartier</a> on my honor thesis in applied math track about dominance graph and ranking. I'm also continuing to work with my <a href="https://sgi.mit.edu/sgi-2021">Summer Geometry Institute (SGI)</a> research group at MIT led by Paul Zhang on hex mesh decomposition.

I'm broadly interested in geometry processing, computer graphics, graph theory, machine learning as well as data analytics.
